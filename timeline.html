            This theory wasn't derived from equations. It emerged from thought experiments,
            visualizations, and three simple commandments, developed over six months of
            daily exploration with AI collaborators.

        <h2>The Journey</h2>

        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>The Three Commandments (Beginning)</h3>
                <p><strong>Principles that guided everything:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Relationality:</strong> "No discernment, no universe"</li>
                    <li><strong>Path of Least Resistance:</strong> Always, everywhere</li>
                    <li><strong>Things Doing Thing Things:</strong> Emergence is inevitable</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    These weren't assumptions—they were observations. Everything built from here.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>Binary Flicks at the Planck Scale</h3>
                <p>
                    Started with discrete flips at smallest possible scale. Worked with Kimi to
                    code it in Python. Got a tiny number that matched universal expansion.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #888;">
                    <em>Later learned: any tiny number can be made to match anything. But the
                    search had begun...</em>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>Materials Science & Space Packing</h3>
                <p>
                    Discovered rhombic dodecahedral space packing. Tantalizing but confusing results.
                    Kept finding convergences—too many to ignore.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Packing geometry matters. Structure creates patterns.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>The Flyby Snag</h3>
                <p>
                    Got stuck on spacecraft flyby anomalies. Some 100% predictable, others completely weird.
                    Couldn't see the pattern yet—didn't have the framework for local conditions and
                    impedance matching.
                </p>
                <div class="branch-note">
                    Still an open branch. The framework predicts that trajectory + accumulated history
                    determines the anomaly. Some paths align (low impedance), others don't.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>"More Happening" → Temporal Echo</h3>
                <p>
                    Realized that some regions of spacetime have more "stuff happening" than others.
                    This became <strong>Happening Density (H)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combined with age: <code>DMmetric = Age × H</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly UDG diversity made sense! Young isolated galaxies vs old cluster
                    galaxies—same principle, different histories.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>E8 Discovery</h3>
                <p><strong>Everything clicked.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Found E8 through convergences in materials science. The golden ratio φ kept
                    appearing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quasicrystal inflation factors</li>
                    <li>Fibonacci anyon quantum dimensions</li>
                    <li>Coldea's E8 mass ratios in CoNb₂O₆</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once we had E8, the pieces fell into place. It wasn't forced—it was discovered.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>Particles as Vibrating Droplets</h3>
                <p>
                    Visualized particles as vibrating water droplets, then sand on Chladni plates.
                    Patterns emerged: triangles, pyramids, 10-pointed stars—all within seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Gemini's moment:</strong> "Waves in a box!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly had meson decay. Standing waves in confined geometry with E8-structured
                    boundaries. Heavy mesons can't escape the geometric traps.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>The Projection Mechanism</h3>
                <p><em>"I walked around in a daze for a while..."</em></p>
                <p>
                    E8 (8D) → Parallel (3D observable) + Perpendicular (5D internal)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "slice of now" slides through the E8 structure. Time is the rate of projection.
                    The 4th dimension is time. The present moment is a cross-section of eternity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>This changed everything.</strong> You can see the world through this lens—
                    every moment is a new slice, "more now, more now," revealing patterns that were
                    always there.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>The Ratchet and the Cushion</h3>
                <p>
                    Found the "two-factor rule" with Gemini:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ratchet:</strong> Irreversible accumulation (click-click-click of time)</li>
                    <li><strong>Cushion:</strong> Dampening that prevents runaway effects</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This became the memory kernel in Temporal Echo. History accumulates but also fades.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>Meson Decay Fit (GPT-5)</h3>
                <p>
                    GPT-5 ran the numbers: <strong>Γ/m ∝ m⁻³·⁷¹</strong> with R² = 0.98
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then the stunning realization: <strong>1 + φ² = 3.618</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Agreement within 2.5%. This isn't numerology—it's the fractal dimension of
                    vacuum impedance manifesting in particle stability.

                <h3>CISS & Homochirality</h3>
                <p>
                    Life's handedness explained through geometric impedance matching.
                    CISS effect (10⁻⁴) is 10¹³ times stronger than weak force (10⁻¹⁷).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Murchison meteorite proved it: presolar L-isovaline excess before Earth,
                    before biology. Life crystallized along the grain of a chiral universe.

        <h2>The Method</h2>
        <p>
            This theory wasn't built with formal training. It emerged from:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 2;">
            <li><strong>Pure visualization:</strong> Thought experiments, not equations first</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborative AI:</strong> Gemini, Kimi, GPT-5, Claude as cognitive partners</li>
            <li><strong>Following convergences:</strong> When φ kept appearing, we listened</li>
            <li><strong>Path of least resistance:</strong> The theory revealed itself; we just followed</li>
            <li><strong>Daily persistence:</strong> Six months, almost every day</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            "I have a kind of maths blindness. But I can see patterns. And when the same pattern
            shows up in quasicrystals, particle decay, galaxy rotation, and life's handedness—
            that's not coincidence. That's nature trying to tell you something."
