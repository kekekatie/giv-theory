        <p>
            <strong>K. T. Niedzwiecki</strong><br>
            Independent Researcher<br>

        <h2>Research Background</h2>

        <p>
            This work represents independent theoretical research developed outside traditional
            academic institutions. The author lacks formal credentials in physics or mathematics.
            However, the framework has been constructed to be empirically testable and makes
            specific quantitative predictions that can be validated or refuted through observation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The research was conducted using computational modeling, extensive literature review,
            and AI-assisted mathematical analysis over approximately six months of intensive
            development (2024-2025).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>

        <p>
            The GIV framework emerged through systematic exploration of geometric principles
            applied across physical scales. Development involved:
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 2;">
            <li>Computational modeling of geometric projections and dimensional reduction</li>
            <li>Statistical analysis of empirical data from particle physics and cosmology</li>
            <li>Integration of established experimental results (Coldea et al., van Dokkum et al., Naaman et al.)</li>
            <li>AI-assisted mathematical formalization and calculation verification</li>
            <li>Iterative refinement based on empirical constraints</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

        <p>
            While unconventional in origin, this framework makes falsifiable predictions across
            multiple physical regimes:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>DDO 154 rotation curve predicted with zero adjustable parameters</li>
            <li>Meson decay power-law exponent within 2.5% of geometric theory</li>
            <li>UDG dark matter correlation statistically significant (p = 0.0061)</li>
            <li>CISS asymmetry 10¹³ times larger than weak force effects</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These results warrant investigation regardless of institutional origin.
            Science advances through empirical validation, not credentials.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Limitations and Falsifiability</h2>

        <p>
            The framework explicitly acknowledges current limitations:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Galaxy cluster mass may be underpredicted (like MOND)</li>
            <li>Gravitational lensing requires relativistic extension</li>
            <li>CMB and structure formation not yet addressed</li>
            <li>Some predictions remain untested</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These are not weaknesses to hide but clearly defined boundaries where the
            model can be tested and potentially falsified. A framework that cannot be
            proven wrong is not scientific.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Peer Review and Validation</h2>

        <p>
            This work has not undergone traditional peer review. The papers are made available
            as preprints for scientific scrutiny and discussion. Feedback, criticism, and
            independent testing are welcomed and encouraged.
        </p>

        <p>
            Several predictions can be tested with existing or near-future observational capabilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Post-merger galaxy rotation curves (should show reduced apparent DM)</li>
            <li>Tidal dwarf galaxies (should be DM-deficient)</li>
            <li>Rotation curve crossover radius r<sub>cross</sub> ~ √(GM<sub>b</sub>/a₀)</li>
            <li>Extended meson decay data in charm and bottom sectors</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

            Researchers interested in testing these predictions, identifying errors, or
            extending the framework are encouraged to engage with the work critically.
